## Introduction
> - Effective communication is crucial for social interaction, education, and work in today's connected world. But conventional communication techniques can be quite difficult for those who are deaf or hard of hearing, which can cause them to feel excluded and alone. 
> - In light of the significance of inclusive communication, we present the "Real-Time Sign Language Interpretation System." This novel method uses state-of-the-art technology to seamlessly translate sign language motions into spoken English and many other regional languages in India in real-time, bridging the communication gap between the hearing and deaf communities. 
> + Our approach seeks to enable people with hearing impairments to participate fully in society by dismantling obstacles and advancing inclusivity, creating a more just and connected environment for everybody.
## Problem Statement
> - The problem addressed is the communication barrier that deaf or hard of hearing people experience, which makes it difficult for them to engage with the hearing community. Conventional techniques, including lipreading or written communication, are frequently ineffective or insufficient. This restricts their ability to engage in social activities, work, and education.
